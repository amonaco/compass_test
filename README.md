Notes
-----

* I was not provided with a sample input file, so I used my own dummy data
* Made the functionality generic so the function can be used for any set of dataset
* Used a very simple similarity scoring mechanism similar to Jaccard index as I guess this was not a machine learning excersise.
* Regarding the output: I took a slightly different approach to printing out rather than a table or CSV output (but that can easily be adjusted).
